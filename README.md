#MemeScheme

MemeScheme is a parody web app designed to generate user created memes. This site was designed with the 'meme aesthetic' in mind. Created by Ummer Khan and Michael Siller.


##Technologies Used
* Python
* Flask
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Heroku
* Peewee
* Sqlite
* Gunicorn

##Description 
MemeScheme is a fun and minimal meme generator website. Users can create an account, and begin posting their own unique memes.
Users input a source for the image (currently URL links only) and also top and bottom text for the meme. All the user's memes are displayed on their User page for other users to see. Users can also scroll through a list of all current memes or go to a specific user's page to see their memes.

##Challenges
Our biggest challenge for this project was connecting the Flask/Python back-end to the React front-end. Sorting out the CORS and fetch requests took the majority of time spent on this project.

##Future Ideas
* Voting/scoring system for users to vote for memes that they enjoyed.
* A "user favorites" list where users could add memes to a list of their favorites.
* Mobile responsiveness for various browser sizes.
* Deployment link for quick-access to the site from a home screen.
